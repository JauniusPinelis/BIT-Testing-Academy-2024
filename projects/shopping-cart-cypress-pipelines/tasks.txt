We have an example of cypress running local application with pipelines in here:
https://github.com/JauniusPinelis/cypress-pipelines

You will perform automated cypress tests on website:
https://qa-practice.netlify.app/products_list

You only need to test 'Shopping cart functionality'

1. Please create a new Github repo for this project, it should be public.
2. Please create testing-scenarios.txt where you describe all the testing cases.
3. Setup initial package.json for running cypress tests and initialize cypress testing.
4. Cover the 'Shopping cart functionality' with Automated Cypress tests.
5. Review the quality, naming, structure of the tests. Maybe you need to write some commands 
    (commands in cypress).
6. Setup pipelines for cypress tests. They should run, when you commit new tests 
    or you should be able to run the manually.
