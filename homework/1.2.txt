We discussed functional testing for front-end applications.
We have created 2 front-end applications: Contact-us and tic-tac-toe.

The homework is to learn about back-end systems.

Most front-end system interact with back-end systems through REST API and json.

1. What is a API? what is a rest api?
2. What is json?
3. Why do we separate Front-end and back-end systems?
4. How do you test REST API? Why is browser not enough.
