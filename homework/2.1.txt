We have two tools for testing REST apis:
1. Swagger https://petstore.swagger.io/
Please do some research on that.
2. Postman

What are the differences between them, similarities?
why both are used?

2. Try importing https://petstore.swagger.io/ into postman.
Try testing it out as well.

3. Try reading and the 'RESTFUL' of openai documentation:
https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/introduction
I will ask the following questions:
 1. What resousrces does this api have?
 2. What is the url for image resources.
 3. What does creating a Thread require? What status code can it return?
