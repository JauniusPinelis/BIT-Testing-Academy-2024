We will learn to launch a React FE web application.

1. Download an react application from 
https://github.com/JauniusPinelis/BIT-Testing-Academy-2024/tree/main/samples/registration-test
and run it locally.

2. Imagine you are a manual tester. And you need to perform  manual 'functional testing' on this 'application'.
Research 'functional testing' and write down some test cases (in english).
