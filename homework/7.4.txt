You got introduced to new REST api https://reqres.in/

Please remember that this is FAKE data api.
CREATES, UPDATES, DELETES will not alter any records.

Please write automated postman tests for the following endpoints:
1. /Register
2. /Login
These endpoints return 'access token', please research what this is.
3. users/{id}/update

Extra: 
Update 6.3 homework with new test scenario for update.
Please check that PUT works as expected. In details, perform PUT 
and then GET and ensure that the data has been modified correctly.

{
    "response": 3
}

// property 'token' of a json is a string

    "token": ""
}
